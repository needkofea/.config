# Kofea's dotfiles


These dotfiles are incomplete.

It is recommended that you first install the dotfiles at `https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots`, before then patching them with these repo's dotfiles.

## NEOVIM
The nvim config is stored in another repository. It is referenced in this repo as a git submodule.

Therefore when cloning, you have to include the `--recurse-submodules` flag.

## Dependencies
1. HyDE - https://github.com/prasanthrangan/hyprdots

   The dotfiles are highly dependent on HyDE and the stuff it installs. So I highly recommend you to HyDE first.

2. `playerctl` - https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl

## Future plans
1. Make the dotfiles fully independent of HyDE
